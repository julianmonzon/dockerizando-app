# DOCKERIZANDO-APP

Task where we work with multiple managed repository options

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Install a Python interpreter

```
Python 3.x (preferably 3.9 or higher)
```

### Installing

A step-by-step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running.

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/julianmonzon/video-club.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd DOCKERIZANDO-APP
```

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```
python -m venv .venv
```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

- On Windows:
  ```
  .venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- On macOS/Linux:
  ```
  source .venv/bin/activate
  ```

5. Since there are no external dependencies, you can proceed to run the script directly:

```
python bienvenida.py
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.

To run the welcome message, simply run:

```
python bienvenida.py
```
